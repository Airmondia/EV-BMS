Background
The advent of electric vehicles (EVs) marks a significant leap towards sustainable transportation, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing environmental impact. Central to the EV's performance is its battery, typically a lithium-ion battery, which dictates the vehicle's range, efficiency, and overall reliability. However, as these batteries are subjected to regular cycles of charging and discharging, their performance degrades over time, affecting their capacity and safety. Thus, predicting the future state of EV batteries becomes crucial for maintaining optimal performance and ensuring safety.
Existing Research and Technologies: Extensive research has been conducted on battery management systems (BMS), focusing on real-time monitoring of battery health and performance. Studies have explored various aspects of battery degradation, including the impact of temperature, charging habits, and cycle depth on battery longevity. While these studies provide valuable insights, there remains a significant gap in predictive modeling that can accurately forecast long-term battery health and identify potential safety risks before they manifest.
Challenges in Battery Health Prediction: One of the main challenges in predicting battery health lies in the complex interplay of factors that contribute to battery degradation. These include not only physical and chemical changes within the battery but also external factors such as usage patterns and environmental conditions. Moreover, the variability in battery manufacturing and the heterogeneity of usage scenarios further complicate the prediction of battery life and safety.
The Need for Advanced Predictive Models: Current BMS largely focus on immediate operational parameters without offering long-term predictions of battery health. Advanced machine learning models, capable of analyzing vast datasets and identifying subtle patterns, offer a promising solution to this challenge. By integrating diverse data sources and employing sophisticated algorithms, these models can forecast battery degradation and safety risks with greater accuracy and lead time, enabling preemptive maintenance and interventions.

This framework is designed to accurately predict the state of EV batteries two months in advance, providing actionable insights into their expected performance and safety. By doing so, we seek to enhance the reliability of EVs, extend the lifespan of their batteries, and contribute to the broader adoption of clean transportation solutions.
In summary, the background section sets the stage for understanding the critical importance of accurate battery health predictions in the EV ecosystem. It outlines the challenges faced by current technologies and the potential of machine learning to offer a more nuanced and forward-looking approach to battery management.
